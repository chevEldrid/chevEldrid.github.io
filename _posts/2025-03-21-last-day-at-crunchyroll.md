Eighteen months later and I'm already jumping to a new opportunity. I definitely didn't think my time at Crunchyroll would be so short but...I suppose that's how these things happen. Starting Monday I'll be working for [Truewind](https://www.truewind.ai/), a "Digital Accounting" startup that just closed their series A in December! This is a crazy opportunity to finally fulfill my dream of working for a startup and I could not be more excited. I'm definitely more prepared than I would have been post-AppFolio given the incredibly technical role I had at Crunchyroll, and with everything else I think this is the perfect time to take the risk associated for working with a company of this size.

This also marks a return to fullstack development from entirely backend. (No, I'm not going to count the random PHP side missions I had to do at Crunchyroll as frontend experience.) After a year and a half of purely NodeJS services and microarchitecture designs it's going to be interesting to jump back in to work that I (maybe naively) feel will be more like AppFolio. Back to B2B, directly connecting with customers, US-based operations. It's still in the finance space, which I think is good for continuing to grow my specialty as a payments engineer - hoping I'll be able to stay fresh building some bank or payment service infrastructure, but realistically I'm still at the point in my career where anything will grow my skills in a very visible way.

So, here's to new opportunities and the excitement of finally fulfilling that startup dream with the title of "Senior Software Engineer". Already started my rewatch of Silicon Valley to prepare for the role.

## Website Updates

Not doing much this week, given the immediate turnaround from Crunchy to Truewind I'm trying to take a bit of a sabatical from random tech work so this will be more of a public list of in-flight features to keep me honest.

- **Picture Support**: Not sure about pictures at the top of blogs, I like the minimal approach for now. BUT I think the ability to add in-line pictures would really benefit the look of everything. So once again we'll be ripping from [hexdrinkers](hexdrinkers.com) to add that ability for future posts.

- **Fiction**: Another main reason I started this blog was to have a place to post little snippets of fiction I'm working on. They'll be sorted separately from the nonfiction blog posts, and eventually probably follow a slightly different style guide but for now I just want to get them _on here_ starting with a recently rejected story about two ghosts in New Orleans. It's awesome I swear.
